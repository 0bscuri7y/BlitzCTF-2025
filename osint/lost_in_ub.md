### -> Gathering Clues by searching for author account and find his Twitter -> From Twitter we get his Blog page (https://zwique.gitbook.io/zwique_notes/achievements/blog-in-ulaanbaatar) <br>

Now at this point I have too much information. The screenshot of chat which shows 16 minute gap between national museum to the hotel bus stop. <br>

This is the bus line he used as mentioned in Blog so after tracking it town I got rough idea of where the bus stop might be since I just had to find the 
bus stop that would take 16 minutes from national museum to the hotel's bus stop. <br>

Now we can use this image and track the hotel.  <br>

Assuming he was in hotel while taking this pic I caluclated the direction which led me to Epos Hotel. 
Which was the flag. <br>
