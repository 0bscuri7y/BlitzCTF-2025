# Hidden Again?

We were supposed to look for the instagram of blitzhack here we can find fragments of flag under different posts in their tags

[#part3](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/part3/) [#d3t3ct1v3_](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/d3t3ct1v3_/)

 [#part2](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/part2/) [#m3d14_](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/m3d14_/)

[#Part1Blitz](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/part1blitz/){s0c14l_
part6- tr34sur3}

and 1 was in the link in their bio

[part4-f0und.xyz](http://part4-f0und.xyz/)

so the flag was 

Blitz{s0c14l_d3t3ct1v3_m3d14_f0und_?_tr34sur3}

and the last part was bruteforced by given context it was h1dd3n making the final flag

making the final flag:-

Blitz{s0c14l_m3d14_d3t3ct1v3_f0und_h1dd3n_tr34sur3}
