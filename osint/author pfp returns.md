## Author ki PFP - Returns

First, of all, I tried to download the shikhar's discord pfp. But it had nothing, so I downloaded the pfp from their own site. I saw that the image was hosted on github, but it never changed. 

Thinking about it, the "backstory" could only be where he told someone about it, but i didn't see any blogs. Then I randomly searched for "pfp" in the BlitzCTF discord server, and results showed shikhar telling about the pfp story last year. He mentioned "keyboard and mouse", which were the answer.
