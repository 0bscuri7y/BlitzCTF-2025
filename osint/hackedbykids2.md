# HACKED BY KIDS PART 2

The Group referenced to part 1 gave out the name of Cracka who was leader of that hacking group. <br>
<br>
So we had to search for his username in discord server of blitz and we got @cracka_1337 which gave 6 links out of which one led to a video which had a pastebin to articles in its description.<br>
<br>

After checking comment section of that article we got cracka telling that he lives in his hometown and talks about a restaurant which closes at 8:30 PM.<br>
<br>
And he also got an IP in his PFP (which was udpate by author later) which after tracking lead us to `

<br>
After filtering out the restaurants we kept looking until we got PHỞ LÊ Vietnamese Restaurant which had a flag in its review section. <br>
