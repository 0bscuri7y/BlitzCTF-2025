# Pieces?

This challenge was a discord challenge that was released before the CTF and we solved it pretty quick

basically some authors/admins have fragments of the flag as their pronouns or their global name and the phrase they shared corresponds to the amount and order of how the fragments have to be arranged

Phrase:- The silent one hides, the watcher stalks, the sly one snickers, the quick one drops, the rebel strikes, the phantom lingers, and the last one laughs.‚Äù

Final Flag:- Blitz{S1l3nt_w4Tch3r_5lY_qU1ck_r3B3l_Ph4nT0m_L4uGh}
