# Auditory Terms

we slowed down the audio file and in the end we can see somewhat hear the flag and based on context we can clearly hear

r 0 b 0 t 1 c underscore v 0

so r0b0t1c_v0

and the ending was very very indaudible but i could somewhat hear v0i but not sure we tried to brute

v01c3

v01ce

and what not but in the end i could clearly hear the voice saying ce in the end so i tried

v0ice and that was it lol nobody in the team had tried that before for some reason xd

so the final flag was 

Blitz{r0b0t1c_v0ice}
